xxxvi IVVENALIS SATVRAE

His device for protecting VII 51-2 is the following punctua-
tion:

50 nam si discedas, laqueo tenet ambitiosi
consuetudo mali. tenet insanabile multos
scribendi cacoethes et aegro in corde senescit,

53 sed uatem egregium

57 anxietate carens animus facit,

which he interprets ‘sunt sane multi quos scribendi cacoethes
etiam in aegritudine teneat, sed uatem uerum animus anxietate
carens facit] If Mr Vahlen had done what conservative critics
hate and fear to do, if he had read the context, he would know
what ‘anxietate carens' means: he would know that it means
‘free from the cares of poverty.’ ‘Neque enim ' continues Juvenal
‘cantare sub antro Pierio potest maesta paupertas: satur est cum
dicit Horatius euhoe.' These misadventures happen, and must
happen, even to eminent scholam, when they have taken a line
and assumed an attitude, and consider rather what is required by
their position and expected by their admirers than what is true or
probable or credible.

In the apparatus criticus, to save space, Ι have neglected many
variants of no moment or significance‚ especially where I use the
sign Ψ. Thus at IV 127 Ι say ‘excidet P Vind. TU ' though Vind.
in truth has eccidet3 at VI 430 Ι say ‘aurata PS, aut lata ⁸1³²
though Ο has aut lota ; and at VII 3 Ι say ‘celebres notique PAG,
noti celebresque ‘P' though L has multi celebresque. Moreover it
must be borne in mind that only four of the MSS, Ρ Vind. AL,
have been thoroughly collated and are fully known: the others,
FGOTU‚ have been examined only in those passages where I record
variations or conjectures, and no inference must elsewhere be·
drawn from silence. I call attention to these shortcomings, but
I make no apology for them. Neither the purveyors nor the
consumers of the ‘apparatus critici' now on sale are in any
position to throw stones at the first production which has ever
deserved that name. This work, as Ι said before, is not meant
for a model 3 it is an enterprise undertaken in haste and in humane
concern for the relies of a people sitting in darkness.
