SATVRAE xxxiii

at XI 161 we can wateh the cause at work. The preceding lines
are these: ‘hic tibi uina dabit diffusa in montibus illis Ι a quibus
ipse uenit, quorum sub uertice lusit.' On u. 160 the scholiast Σ
has this note: ‘a quibus ipse uenit. de eadem uilla uinum, unde
et minister est.' The same comment, cast into metre, now stands
in our texts as u. 161, ‘namque una atque eadem est uini patria
atque ministri.’ Similarly the ‘ consuetudo mali' of VII 51 comes
from a gloss upon the ‘cacoethes’ of u. 50, which Σ explains
‘ mali mores uel mala consuetudo scribendi.³ And that scandal of
all interpolations, ΙΙΙ 281 ‘ergo non aliter poterit dormire, quibus—
dam,’ appears to have been built up in like manner around a
marginal explanation of u. 282 ‘somnum rixa facit?

These verses were the work of readers who saw what Juvenal
meant3 but now come others composed by readers who did not.

Juvenal at ΠΙ 112, inveighing against the libidinousness of the
Greek, concludes with the hyperbole ‘horum si nihil est, auiam
resupinat amici.' To a reader who has not followed the sense it
seems that this is a strange act and wants explaining, and he
invents the false explanation n. 113 ‘scire uolunt secreta domus
atque inde timeri.’

In V 60-79 are depicted the affronts which a poor client
receives from even the lowest drudges of his wealthy patron.
The interpolator has heard talk of pampered menials, and he
interjects u. 66 ‘ maxima quaeque domus seruis est plena superbis.’
That may be true, but it is not the point, and it spoils the point:
‘ serui superbi ' have been mentioned in 56 sqq. and left behind at
62 : the point is the insolence, not of supercilious flunkeys but of
blackamoors from the stableS, exhibited not towards the world at
large but towards poor elien ts in particular.

In XI 7 8—89 Juvenal has described the simple food of the
early Romans 3 in 90—109 he proceeds, with autem, to describe the
simplicity of their household gear. Into the midst of this second
passage, between the couch and the platter, is dropped the verse
99 ‘tales ergo cibi, qualis domus atque supellex.' If tales . . .
qualis were altered to quales . . . talis, this comment would be
what its writer meant it to be, a counterpart to u. 108 ‘ponebant
igitur Tusco farrata catino'3 but its writer (that is, according to
the editorS, Juvenal), having neglected to study the context,
mistook the sense of U. 108, and supposed it to signify ‘they
placed simple food upon their simple dishes,' whereas it really
means ‘they used simple dishes for their simple food.’
