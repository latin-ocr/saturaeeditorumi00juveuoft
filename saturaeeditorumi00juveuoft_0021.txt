SATVRAE xvii

with falsehoods. In P we find the one MS which has escaped the
shower3 or rather we find the shower suspended over it, and only
the first drops fallen. True, the readers of this edition will
discover that many genuine lections hitherto supposed peeuliar to
P are in fact preserved by one or two or even most of Ψ; but
the integrity 01 Ρ is still by far superior, and since my apparatus
criticus has torn so many feathers from its erest I will here set
out in array the proudest plumes which yet remain to it. I 52

clament Ψ, XII 59 taedae P, taeda Ψ, xv 25 damerat P, deduxerat Ψ;
these are only the most striking and important 01 the many
examples in which P, sometimes accompanied by Vind., preserves
the truth where Ψ are falsified. In tei-polation therefore is frequent
in Ψ, in P it is extremely rare : perhaps the only certain instances
are VI 347 prohibe for cohibe and XI 91 postremo for riqidique3
though at VI 159 the gloss nudo has supplanted mero, and there
are several corruptions which verge upon interpolation, III 61
faecis Achaeae for Achaei, 141 possidet αξη-οε for aqri, VI 565 hic
tetricae for ictericae, IX 22 nouerit illos for non erit illis, XI 118 hoc
liquam for hos, XIII 143 hile. ferenda for ferendam, XIV :33 animis
auctoribus for animos, xv 26 hic Ithacus for haec.

But P has no further superiority to Ψ. there the splash 01 I
interpolation has not fallen, and the original fabric 01 Ψέ text is
visible, there it is as good as P's and often better. For P, though ,
little interpolated, is much corrupted, and the list of places
where all editors resort to Ψ is, as I said before, a long one.
What follows is only a selection 3 it does not repeat the eleven
examples quoted at the end 01 the last paragraph ; and it excludes
those passages, which I shall cite hereafter, where the genuine
reading is found only in one or two of the seven MSS which I call
Ψ. 1 38 noctibas Ψ, non tibi P, 155 lucebis Ψ, lucebit Ρ, 11 80
