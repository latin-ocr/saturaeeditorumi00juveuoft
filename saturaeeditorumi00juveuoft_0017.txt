SATVRAE xiii

and leave room for their superiors2 that is forbidden by vanity.
They must have a rule, a machine to do their thinking for them.
If the rule is true, so much the better3 if false, that cannot be
helped: but one thing is necessary, a rule.

A hundred years ago it was their rule to count the MSS and
trust the majority. But this pillow was snatched from under
them by the great critics of the l9th century, and the truth that
MSS must be weighed, not counted, is now too widely known to be
ignored. The sluggard has lost his pillow, but 116 has kept his
nature, and must needs find something else to loll on; so he
fabricatas, to suit the change of season, his precious precept of '3
following one MS wherever possible. Engendered by infirmity ³
and designed for comfort, no wonder if it misses the truth at
which it was never aimed. Its aim was purely humanitarian:
to rescue incompetent editors alike from the toil of editing and
from the shame of acknowledging that they cannot edit.

Frailty of understanding is in itself no proper target for
scorn and mockery: ‘nihil in eo odio dignum, misericordia digna
multa.’ But the unintelligent forfeit their claim to compassion
when they begin to indulge in sels-complacent airs, and to call
themselves sane critics, meaning that they are mechanics. And
when, relying upon their numbers, they pass from self-complacency
to insolence, and reprove their betters for using the brains which
God has not denied them, they dry up the fount of pity. ‘D'ou
vient' asks Pascal ‘qu'un boiteux ne nous irrite pas, et qu'un
esprit boiteux nous irrite? C'est ἐι cause qu’un boiteux reconnoit
que nous allons droit, et qu'nn esprit boiteux dit que c’est nous
qui boitons3 sans cela nous en aurions plus de pitie que de colere)
If a hale man walks along the street upon two sound legs, he is
not liable to be chased by crowds of cripples vociferating ‘Go
home and fetch your crutch.' If a reasoning man edits a classic
rationally, he is.

WVhen the Pithoeanus has one reading and other MSS another,
and it is sought to determine which reading, if either, is true,
then, if a critic attempts to settle the question, as critics will, by
pertinent considerations, considerations of sense or usage or
palaeography, he is exposed to a form of molestation from which
the students of other sciences are probably exempt. He is pretty
sure to be told that the judgment of critics is fallible, which he
knew already, and that he ought to follow the authority of the
best MS P. Now ask the intermeddler a question which he has
