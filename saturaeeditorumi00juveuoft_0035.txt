SATVRAE xxxi

There remains a question whose recent history is the least
creditable chapter in Juvenalian criticism. Jahn in his edition 01
1868 expelled from the text as spurious some seventy verses.
Mr Buecheler expels one, IX 1193 Mr Friedlaender none at all.
‘In der That' says he on p. 56 ‘giebt es unechte Verse im Text
des Juvenal eben so wenig als doppelte Recensionen' 5 and then
he adds ‘ auch keine Liicken und keine Umstellungen von Versen.’
As to ‘Lficken,' we learnt in 1899 that more than thirty verses “
113(1 been lost in sat. VI alone, and nobody had missed them 3 as to
‘Umstellungen,' we learnt that the three verses VI 3464& are

· twenty lines away from their proper place, and nobody had

guessed it ; and ΜΓ Friedlaender's assertion about ‘unechte
Verse' deserves credence ‘eben so wenig.’ It is merely the
confident talk of one who knows that his own opinions are shared
by the majority 01 1113 audience.

Forty years ago it was the fashion to be suspicious; and
scholars eJ'ected from the text 01 Juvenal every verse that could
be spared, and judged themselves acute for doing so. Now it is
the fashion to be insensible 3 and scholars lay claim to the merit
of caution when they accept as genuine every verse which the text
01 Juvenal contains. For steering a middle course Ι 0131111 110
merit at all, except the slight and negative merit 01 setting fashion
at naught and 01 taking warning by terrible examples. Truth
and wisdom have never been the fashion, no more than virtue 3
and 101· the same reason, because they are not easy to attain. The
question whether Juvenal's text contains spurious verses, and, 11
30, which those verses are, is a question demanding more thought
than any large number of men at any one period are either willing
or able to bestow upon it. But all can follow the 133111οῃ, 101·
that needs no pains and no brains.

There are some verses, good in themselves and suitable to
their context, as 111 242, V 51, VI 27 4, which were formerly
removed for no better reason than that it was possible to remove
them without leaving a visible gap. One 01 this sort, XI 109,
was ejected simply because the old editions printed it before
u. 108, where it was inappropriate ς and Jahn, even after
Achaintre had restored it to its right place, mechanically persisted
in condemning it 101· reasons which had ceased to exist. There
are other verses, as VI 640, VII 138, IX 48—9, which were expelled =
because they or their contexts were not rightly understood by the ¹
critic. Then we come to lines whose origin is proper matter for
