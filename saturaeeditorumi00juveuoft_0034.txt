xxx IVVENALIS

Twice then, by the purest accident, have we caught the copyists
at their tricks 3 and we see what their tricks were like. When
Mr Friedlaender proceeds ‘Daher ist der Conjecturalkritik nicht
bloss ein sehr geringer Spielraum gelassen, sondern auch bei Herstel-
lungsversuchen die grosste Vorsicht geboten,' his words are true
for a reason very unlike the reason which he assigns. To emend
Juvenal is difficult, and to attempt his emendation is dangerous;
but this difficulty and danger arise not from the soundness of his
text but its corruption. The scribes have depraved it by altera-
tions so violent and so unscrupulous that correction, instead of
being, as Mr Friedlaender thinks, unnecessary, must often be
impossible.

To many of my conJ'ectures, such for instance as that at VI
158, where I suppose qestare to have been absorbed by castae and
its loss made good by borrowing dedit hunc from overhead, the
objection will be made that they assume too many steps and
involve too many hypotheses. That is precisely the obJ'ection
which would have been made if all the MSS gave multo sufflamine
at VIII 148 and I had proposed sufflamine mulio and suggested that
mulio was first changed to multo and multo then transposed to help
the metre. In a text which has corruptions of this nature, the
corrections, if they are to be corrections, must take this nature
too 3 and what Ι have done is to recognise facts and conform my
practice to reality. It will further be complained that Ι alter the
text in places where no former editor has even suspected it. Till
sufflamine mulio was produced in 1885 from the florilegium
Sangallense, no editor suspected multo sufflamine: what editor now
defends it or even reckons it defensible‘l

I have placed in the text not only conjectures which Ι think
certain, such as ferendis at VI 195, but also others, such as ac similis
at XIV 269, which I think doubtful. This I do to arrest attention
and challenge opposition. What is important is not that Ι should
correct and explain Juvenal but that Juvenal should be corrected
and explained: if the text is right, and Ι have missed the sense,
let others trace it3 if the text is wrong, and Ι have failed
to right it, let others try. The conjecture of which Ι expect to
hear most evil is ramitis at XI 168. That conjecture will entice
its adversaries to do what they have never done before, to read
the passage with attention. If they can then attempt a defence
of diuitis, let them attempt it by all means: if it succeedS, I shall
claim half the credit.
