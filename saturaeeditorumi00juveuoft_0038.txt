xxxiv IVVENALIS

Almost every one in the world, says Juvenal in XII 48-9, loves
riches better than life itself and would sooner perish than be poor.
Certain persons adds somebody in 50-1, blinded by a flaw of
character‚—attend, here comes the climax‚—live to make fortunes
instead of making fortunes to live. Certain persons, that is, are
so avaricious that they evince less avarice than the author of 48—9
imputes to mankind in general.

Some bad men, says Juvenal in XIII 86—9, are atheists, and
therefore commit perjury without a qualm. Another type of
man (hic), he proceeds in 91-108, believes in God yet commits
perjury all the same, loving the prize more than he fears the
penalty, and hoping also to be forgotten or forgiven. A reader
who did not see the sense of hic, and thought to provide it with
a reference, has inserted u. 90 ‘est alius metuens ne crimen poena
sequatur’3 so that perjurers are now divided, not into atheists
and theists, but into atheists and those who dread punishment,
and it is then mentioned in passing that these latter are theists.

One or two interpolations, more excusable than these, have
arisen from corruption or other troubles in the text. VIII 122-3 :
‘tollas licet omne quod usquam est Ι auri atque argenti‚' wrote
Juvenal, ‘scutum gladiumque relinques,' ‘you will yet leave them
sword and shield‚' that is weapons both offensive and defensive.
Just as VII 139 ‘fidimus eloquio' etc. had an alternative opening,
‘ut redeant ueteres‚’ so this verse had an alternative close,
‘spoliatis arma supersunt) It is possible, not probable, that both
versions are the poet's, ‘spoliatis’ etc. his first thought, ‘scutum ’
etc. his own improvement on himself 3 but it is more likely that
‘spoliatis' etc. is a paraphrase, designed to explain in general
terms the sense which ‘ scutum ' etc. conveyS, after the fashion of
Latin poetry, by symbols. If either ending had ousted the other,
or if, as at VII 139, the MSS were divided between the two, no
great harm would have been done; but here some editor has
combined the alternatives by forging a link of his own, ‘et
iaculum et galeam,’ without seeing the consequence 3 not observing
that scutum and ylaclz'um, at this addition, instantly forfeit their
symbolic character, and that, whereas ‘ scutum gladiumque ' meant
arms of all sorts, ‘scutum gladiumque et iaculum et galeam'
means arms of four sorts.

IX 119 is an interpolation equally well-meant and equally
disastrous. In u. 118 the source of P and A had the false reading
‘uiuendum recte est, cum propter plurima, tunc est,' upon which
