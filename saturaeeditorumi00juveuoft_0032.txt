xxviii IVVENALIS

Our purest source of knowledge, better than P or any MS, is Σ.
thether it takes P’s part against Ψ or Ψέ against P, it is almost
always in the right: rare indeed are examples like IV 64, where
it errs with Ψ in sayinis, or VI 34, where it errs with P in punqio.
But its chief and transcendent virtue is its retention or indication
of genuine readings which are falsified in all the MSS, at IV 25,
vi 320, 660, vn 40, x 304, X1v 45, xv 64, to which I add 111 205,
IV 8, IX 134, XI 148, XIII 179, and perhaps VII 22 and XIV 269.

‘Nothing' I hear it asked, ‘about Nicaeus'l Nothing about
Epicarpius, nor Heiricus, nor the long-resounding name of
Exuperantius‘l' No, nothing. The truth is, and the reader
has discovered it by this time if he did not know it beforehand,
that I have no inkling of Uherlicferunysqeschichte. And to the
sister science of Quelletfforschmzy I am equally a stranger z Ι cannot
assure you, as some other writer will assure you before long, that
the satires of Juvenal are all copied from the satires of Turnus.
It is a sad fate to be devoid of faculties which cause so much
elation to their owners 3 but Ι cheer myself by reflecting how large
a number of human beings are more fortunate than I. It seems
indeed as if a capacity for these two lines of fiction had been
bestowed by heaven, as a sort of consolation-prize, upon those
who have no capacity for anything else.

So much for the recension of Juvenal's text where the MSS
differ: now for its explanation or emendation where they agree.
Here also there is much to do3 more than one might fancy,
considering how many readers these Satires have found and how
long and often they have been edited. But the fact is that
Juvenal has never been taken in hand by a critic of the first order.
If, instead of Pithoeus and Rigaltius and Ruperti and Jahn, it
were Scaliger and Gronouius and Bentley and Lachmann that
had been here before uS, not much would now remain unexplained
or uncorrected except the inexplicable and the incorrigible. But
though Juvenal has had editors of much learning and of some
judgment and acuteness, not one of them has possessed a really
,penetrating and comprehensive mind. Probably no recension
or commentary has done so much for the amendment and inter—
pretation of the text as Markland's desultory notes and the two
disputatione of the youthful Madvig. Still, the world moves,
the 19th century has slowly accumulated corrections 3 Ruperti,
