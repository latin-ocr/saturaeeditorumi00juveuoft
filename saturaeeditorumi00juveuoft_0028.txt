xxiv IVVENALIS

are U and G. A, which if P were lost would be very valuable, is⁴
now of less moment than some of its inferiors, since it contains
but little truth which could not be elicited from P. Next to U and
G in importance, not in general merit, stands Ο.1 F and T are more
noteworthy for certain striking affinities to P (not only in the true
readings mentioned above but also in errors) than for their own
independent virtue. L may seem from these lists to be an
unimportant MS, but that is by no means so: and here I must
say what there is to be said about the relation of J uvenal's MSS to
one another.

Authors like Juvenal, read and copied and quoted both in
antiquity and in the middle ages, have no strictly separated
families of MSS. Lections are bandied to and fro from one copy
to another, and all the streams of tradition are united by canals.
The one firm line of severance now subsisting is the division
which marks off P from all its rivals: they are smothered under
interpolation, it is not. But if their interpolation could be lifted
away, and this line of severance abolished, another would reveal
itself, not in the same place.

Every one of our MSS had for its aneestor, near or remote, a
MS such as we now behold in P: a text of comparative purity
with marginal corrections and interpolations by a second hand.
The ancestor of A, if we possessed it, would be almost the double
of P: it would omit, for instance, the last word of IX 82, and
it would give the true reading duxerat at XV 25. But the ancestor
of L would differ much from P, and the ancestor of U would not
only differ from P but would probably excel it. We are now to
consider a class of differences which the removal of mere interpola-

aspect a more important MS than P. As to the probable history of these verses
1 will briefly repeat what has been said by Mr P. von Winterfeld in Berl. Phil.
Woch. 1899 pp. 793 sq. and Goett. Gel. Anz. 1899 pp. 895-7 and by me in
class. Rev. 1901 p. 265. It seems that O, which unlike most of Juvenal’s MSS
is Langobardic‚ was copied in some library, probably Italian, containing an
ancient MS in which the verses were still extant; and the scribe, having this
book at his elbow, observed the additional matter and incorporated it in his
text. As to the disappearance of these lines from the archetype, the loss of
373A and 373ss was purely accidental, like the loss of 632 and 633 in P. The
first 29 verses of the longer fragment were probably a single page; and the
pages of P and Arou. contain also 29 verses apiece. The rest of the paragraph,
30-34, was not omitted3 only corrupted, contracted, and transferred to a less
obviously untenable post between 345 and 349.

On the interpretation of this fragment and its connexion with the context
Ι have written in Class. Rev. 1899 pp. 266-7‚ 1901 pp. 263—5‚ 1904 pp. 397-8.
