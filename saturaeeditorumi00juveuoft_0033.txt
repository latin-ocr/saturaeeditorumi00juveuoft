SATVRAE xxix

Heinrich, Jahn, Hermann, Ribbeck, Buecheler, have each con-
tributed something, and ΜΓ Friedlaender’s comment-ary is a
serviceable work and much superior to its predecessors: though
after all, if candour and clear perception are what is wanted,
the best place to find them is the unpretending school-edition
of Mr J. D. Duff.

The errors, at any rate the visible errors, in Juvenal’s text are
fewer than in most Latin authors. Long passages can be read
without encountering other checks than arise from our scanty
knowledge of the matters touched or glanced at. And because
the errors are few, therefore they are supposed to be slight. ‘Der
Text ist im Ganzen vortrefflich erhalten‚’ says ΜΓ Friedlaender
on p. 94, ‘die Corruptelen beschranken sich auf einzelne Silben
oder Buchstaben.' This groundless affirmation was made in 1895
and overheard by Nemesis. Four years she waited, and then in
1899 she brought out from the arsenals of divine vengeance, if I
may so describe the Bodleian library, a lost fragment of the Sixth
satire, which casts a dire illumination upon one short chapter in
the history of this ‘excellently preserved text! We now know
that at some remote epoch twenty-nine verses were omitted after
VI 365 and left this headless sequel,

consilia et ueteres quaecumque monetis amici,
‘pone seram, cohibe.' sed quis custodiet ipsos
custodes, qui nunc lasciuae furta puellae

hac mercede silent? crimen commune tacetur.
prospicit hoc prudens et ab illis incipit uxor.

In our MSS these lines have been battered into the following shape

audio quid ueteres olim moneatis amici,
‘ pone seram, cohibe.’ sed quis custodiet ipsos
custodes? cauta est et ab illis incipit uxor,

and have been transported to a new station between 345 and 349
in the vain hope of providing them with an Iappropriate context.
Again at IV 8 the ancient scholia propound interpretations which
are inexplicable except on the hypothesis that they found in their
text the reading

nemo malus felix quin sit corruptor.

Of· this they could make no sense, and small wonder: the scribes
could make no sense of it either, so all our MSS now offer us

nemo mal us felix, minime corruptor.
