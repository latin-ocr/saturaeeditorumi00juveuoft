A YEAR ago Ι had no design of publishing or composing any such
work as this. Ι knew indeed that the current texts of Juvenal,
though praised in reviews and seemingly acceptable to readers,
were neither well founded nor well constructed, and that this
classic, like many more, had suffered some hurt from the reign-
ing fashion of the hour, the fashion of leaning on one manuscript
like Hope on her anchor and trusting to heaven that no harm
will come of it. But Ι neither realised the extent of this injury
nor fully understood its causes. Ι ascribed it firstly to the sloth
and distaste for thinking which are the common inheritance of
humanity, and secondly to that habit of treading in ruts and
trooping in companies which men share with sheep. I did not
know that it had also a third source, sheer ignorance of facts,
and that the editors had left undone the first of all their duties
and neglected to provide the author with an apparatus criticus.

In October 1903, having been asked by Mr Postgate to
undertake the recension of Juvenal for his Corpus Poetarum, Ι
began to gather from printed sources the recorded variants 3 and
I soon discovered that J uvenal’s modern editors were ignorant or
regardless of even the printed sources. I consulted the oldest
MSS in the British Museum, but there was little to be learnt
from these3 so returning to the published records I chose out
seven authorities which seemed to emerge above the crowd and
to possess some value of their own. Two of these, thanks to
Mr Hosius, were collated already 3 two were in Eugland, so I
examined them myself 3 three were abroad‚ but of these I pro-
cured enough knowledge for my purpose. Their testimony, with
that of the Viennese and other fragments, I have added to the
witness of our prime authority the Pithoeanus 3 and Ι now present
to the readers and especially to the editors of Juvenal the first
apparatus criticus which they have ever seen.
