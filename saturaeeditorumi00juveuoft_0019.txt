SATVRAE xv

by assuming as proved the general conclusion for which we
are now collecting materials is, in the full sense of the term,
preposterous.'

. The truth is that when these gentlemen talk about the
authority of better MSS they are repeating at second hand a
phrase which they have caught up and run away with. They
have overheard critics using it, but what the critics meant by it
they do not understand. There is a sphere‚ a narrow sphere,
within which the authority of better MSS is properly and usefully
invoked, not indeed as a good means of arriving at the truth‚
but as the best means available. Ι 2 ‘rauci Theseide Cordi’ P,
Codri ⁸1¹: the man's name is unknown. Ι 21 ‘si uacat ac placidi
rationem admittitis' Ρ, et Ψ; there is not a pin to choose.
1 134 ‘caulis miseris atque ignis emendus⁷ P, caules ²1¹: the
singular is no better than the plural nor the plural than the
singular. To decide what Juvenal wrote in these places the
J'udgment is helpless: here then we avail ourselves of an instru-
ment which the judgment has forged and put into our hands:
our knowledge or opinion of the relative merits of the MSS.
Since we have found P the most trustworthy MS in places where
its fidelity can be tested, we infer that it is also the most trust-
worthy in places where no test can be applied3 and we read Cordi, ι
ac, caulis. In thus committing ourselves to the guidance of the “
best MS we cherish no hope that it will always lead us right: we
know that it will often lead us wrong3 but we know that any
other MS would lead us wrong still oftener. By following any
other MS we shall only be right in the minority of cases;
by following P we shall be right in the majority: that is all we
look for. A critic therefore, when he employs this method
of trusting the best MS, employs it in the same spirit of gloomy
resignation with which a man lies down on a stretcher when he
has broken both his legs. But far other is the spirit in which it
is hailed by the reciter of formulas. He is not deJ‘ected by
its inadequacy, but captivated by its ease. ‘Here' says he ‘is a
method, sanctioned by critics‚ employed in scientific inquiry, and
yet involving not the slightest expenditure of intellectual effort:
this is the method for me'3 and he espouses it for ever. In
places where critics rise up and walk, where judgment has scope
and authority is superseded, he remains supine and marvels at
the vagaries of pedestrians: presumptuous beings who expect to
reach their goal by the capricious and arbitrary method of
