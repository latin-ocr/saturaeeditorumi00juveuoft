viii IVVENALIS

but this damage can sometimes be repaired from three frag—
mentary sources which are closely allied to P. One is the
Arou. scidae Arouienses, five leaves 01 1116 10111 01 11111 century found
at Aarau and brought 10 notice in 1880 by H. WVirz in Hermes
XV pp. 437—448. These preserve the verses ΙΙ 148-155, 111 6-13‚
35—92, VI 136—193‚ 252-368, 427—484, vn 57472, written on
pages which tally in size and shape with P⁷s, which contain like
them 29 verses apiece‚ and each of which contains the same 29
verses as the corresponding page 01 Ρ. Α second source is the
flor· florilegium Sangallense contained in the codex Sangallensis 870
sang. 01 1116 9th century and collated in 1885 by C. Stephan in the
Rheinisches Museum XL pp. 263-282. Third and most important
S are the lemmata, S, 01 1116 ancient scholia, Σ, preserved in dupli—
cate by this same cod. Sang. 870 and by P itself. These lemmata
often disagree with the scholia to which they are prefixed, but
they coincide remarkably, though not exactly, with the text 01
P, and they now and then excel it. NVhere S or Sang. or Arou.
agrees with P, there we have the reading 01 611 earlier MS from
which P was directly or with little interval derived.

Over against P and its small cluster 01 kinsfolk stand the
several hundreds 01 Juvenal's vulgar MSS, dating from the 9th
century to the 16111, infected one and all with a plague of
interpolation from which P and its fellows are exempt. But
about half—way between the two camps lies a considerable frag-
ment, older it appears than P, in which the malady has made

Vind. no very formidable progress, codex Vindobonensis 107 01 CXI, 01
1116 9111 century, containing the verses Ι 1—11 59 and Π 107—V 96,
collated by A. Goebel in the Sitzungsber. d. k. k. Akad. d. Wiss.
philos-histor. CL, Vienna 1859, pp. 37—75.

Ψ Then come the seven MSS which I have chosen out 01 the
multitude, AFGLOTU.

A Monacensis 408, in the royal library at Munich, 01 1116 11111
century, collated by C. Hosius in 1888.

Γ Parisiensis 8071, Jahn's f, in the national library at Paris,
01 the 10111 century, lacking the verses Ι 1—111 316 and IX 40-150,
examined for me by Mr Charles Samaran and afterwards in a
few places by Mr Louis Brandin.

G Parisiensis 7 9002 Jahn’s 9, in the same library, 01 1116 same
century, similarly examined by Mr Samaran and Mr Brandin.

1, Leidensis 82, in the public libi-ary at Leyden, of the 11th
century, collated by C. Hosius in 1888.
