SATVRAE vii

On p. xiii he says ‘Vindobonensem 107 (phil. 128) saeculi noni
uel decimi accuratissime conlatum habui ab Alfredo Holdero
amico.' It is a pity that Mr Holder should have taken so much
trouble 3 firstly because the MS was fully collated so long ago as
1859, secondly because the only use Mr Buecheler has made 01
his ‘accurate collation' is to conceal it from the public. The
Vindobonensis, between 1 1 and v 96, not only shares with P
fifteen genuine readings which the public believes to exist in P
alone⁷ but has half-a-dozen genuine readings which are not in P;
ΙΙΙ 18 presentius, 67 trecheclipnffi 168 neyalns, IV 3 aeqrae, 4 aspernatas,
147 cattis. Μ1 Buecheler adopts some 01 these readings and
mentions others, but the vindobonensis he does not mention,
and at ΙΙΙ 18 116 makes believe that praesentius is nothing but a
conjecture.

There have been three serious attempts to compile an
apparatus criticus. Ruperti in 1801 collected the variants
cited by his predecessors and collated eighteen German MSS
himself3 but few of these are ancient, none seems good, and
none is so collated as to be fully known. Next, in 1851, came
Otto Jahn, who printed Bertin's minute though not exact colla-
tion 01 the Pithoeanrm, and added excerpts from eight other MSS
01 which two at least are important. These excerpts however
are not only meagre but grossly and almost incredibly inaccurate :
Jahn's merits were the judgment with which he singled out a
few good witnesses from the huge array of Juvenal's extant MSS
and the learning and industry he bestowed 011 collecting citations
of the poet from ancient authors. Lastly Mr Carl Hosius
published in 1888 an ‘apparatus criticus ad quenalem’ in
which he gave a full collation 01 six MSS and four florilegia.
The title is a misnomer, but the work had great value, since it
enabled us 101 the first time to survey the common text in its
entirety and to compare it throughout with P's. But for Mr
Hosius’ collation 01 Monacensis 408 and Leidensis 82 I could
hardly have set about constructing the present apparatus,

The principal MS of Juvenal is the Pithoeanus‚ now 125 in Ρ
the medical library of Montpellien written about the end 01 the
9th century, first employed by P. Pithoeus in 1585, collated by
J. V. Bertin for Jahn, and more accurately by F. Buecheler in
his edition 01 1893. Its original readings are often effaced by

the corrections 01 later hands from the lOth century onward, p
