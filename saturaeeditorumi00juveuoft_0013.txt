SATVRAE ix

Canonicianus class. Lat. 41 in the Bodleian library at Oxford, o
of the 11th century, presenting thirty-four verses between sat.
VI 365 and 366, and two more between 373 and 374, which are
found in no other MS, first brought to notice by E. O. Winstedt
in 1899, examined by me and afterwards in several places by
Mr T. C. Snow.

O, IV, 10 in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, of the Τ
lOth century, first brought to notice by J. D. Duff in 1898, examined
by me and afterwards in a few places by Μι- Postgate and Mr
Duff, the latter of whom allowed me also to make use of his own
excerpts from the MS.

Vrbinas 661 in the library of the Vatican, Jahn’s h, of the U
llth century, lacking the verses VI 156—215, examined for me
by Mr E. O. Winstedt and afterwards in a few places by Mr
Georges Perinelle.

These are all the MSS which I have constantly employed.
But Ι have now and again made use of others which here and
there distinguish themselves either by preserving a true reading
or by quitting the vulgar text to side with P. These, where
cited in the notes, are called by their names. Among them are
Laurentianus plut. XXXIV 42 saec. XI, Jahn's a 3 Parisiensis 9345
saec. XI, Hosius’ H3 Ruperti's Gaybacensis 2 saec. XIII 3 a mutilated
codex Parisiensis 7906 saec. IX negligently collated by W.
Foerster in the Zeitschr. f. oest. Gymn. XXVII pp. 258 sqq. 3
the excerpts made by Fr. Daniel from a lost MS which are printed
by R. Beer on p. 36 of his Spicilegium quenalianum3 the
florilegium Frisingense 92 or codex Monacensis 6292 saec. X—XI
and the florilegia Parisina 7646 saec. XII and 17903 saec. XIII
collated by Hosius. The MSS in the British Museum which I have
myself examined are the following: 15600 saec. IX, 15 Β XII
saec. x, 30861 and 15 B XVII and XVIII saec. XI, 11672 saec. XIII,
and Burneianus 192 saec. XV.

Apart from all other MSS stands a single fragment far older
than any, discovered by Angelo Mai and printed by G. Goetz
ind. schol. aest. Ienae 1885: the palimpsestus Bobiensis, 5750 in Bob.
the Vatican library‚ assigned to the end of the 4th century,
containing the verses XIV 323-xv 43 together with scholia. It
agrees now with P, now with the other MSS, and its text, for all
its antiquity, is not superior to P's.

It remains to mention the ancient scholia preserved in Σ
duplicate by P and by the cod. Sang. 870 twice named above.
