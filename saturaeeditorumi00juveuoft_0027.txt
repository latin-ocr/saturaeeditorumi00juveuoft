I add a record of the frequency with which each one of these
seven MSS adheres to P in good readings not given by the six
others, and with which each couple adheres to P in good readings
not given by the remaining five. A in 28 places, F in 14, G in
19, L in 1, o in 10, r in 6,u in 22. AF in 1, AG in 7, AL in 1,
Ao in 4, AT in 2, AU in 8, FG in 8, FT in 2, FU in 5, GL in 3,
Go in I, GT in 2, GU in 16, OT in 2, OU in 2, TU in 2.

It is clear that the best and most important of the seven MSS

The better form epistula is preserved by P at Iv 49 and X 71. In the third
place where Juvenal uses the word, XVI 5, P gives epistola, but epistula is
found in GLTU.

The editors accept formonsa from P at VI 465 and xrrl 43: in the latter
place this form is also given by F. From F therefore I accept formonsa at VI
162 and sermons-issimus at X 331, though P has the common spelling.

The old fashion of writing ss after a long vowel appears in P at IX 96
commissam, which the editors admit. I admit also the ussus of Vind. at 1v 139.

P, with many Mss beside, has the true form murrina at VII 133, and the
editors follow it ; at VI 156 it has the false form myrrhina, and they follow it
again. Ι take murrina from AFL ; and further at XIII 25 I write puxide with
S, at xv 35 Tentura with Bob., and at xv 76 Tentura with P, just as the
editors write berullo with P at v 38.

Juvenal uses the preposition apud five times. In four places, VI 395, 489,
XI 137, XV 31, the form aput is adopted from P, which has U to support it in
the first two places, GT in the third, and Bob. 111 the fourth. In the fifth
place, VI 91, where P has apud, I adopt aput from TU Sang. Moreover, since
Bob. has set at XV 27 and 38 and adque at 33, Ι would follow P in every place
where it presents these forms, if Ι knew which those places are ; but I do not,
for Bertin’s collation is untrustworthy and Buecheler's defective.

The Ciceronian iz· between two vowels can be traced so clearly in the
corruptions of J uvenal's MSS that I have admitted it into the text. Its disguises
are ll (IV 113 and 123 ueHento, VI 320 and IX 117 laufella), ri (11 19 perfores,
IV 13 serio), and n (111 185 umento, VII 90 salano).

In places where Ι adopt the spelling of P I do not always mention the
divergence of the other Mss; as for example at 1 122, where all Mss but P, so
far as Ι am aware, have praequam and not yiraeynas.
