xvi IVVENALIS

putting forward first one foot, and then, with strange inconsistency,
the other.

Misfortunes never come single, and the prattlers about P's
authority are afflicted not only with lack of understanding but
with loss of memory. They forget that they themselves
repeatedly do what they say that we ought not to do 3 repeatedly
prefer their own judgment to the authority of the Pithoeanus.
The Pithoeanus at Ι 35 omits the word palpat, but they will not
omit it3 at Ι 38 it reads uon tibi, but they will read noctibus:
they will follow the worse MSS instead of the best. For deserting
the Pithoeanus then they cannot blame us, since in that action
we agree with them: they must blame us for the feature in
which our conduct differs from theirs. Oui· offence is that
we do not desert the Pithoeanus in the proper spirit, the spirit of
rats leaving a sinking ship. We quit the best MS in search of
truth: we ought only to quit it, as they do, in search of shelter.
In inquiring whether a given reading of P's is right, we behave as
if we really wanted to know, and we ask whether it is probable z
they ask only whether it is possible, and unless it is impossible
they believe it to be right: much as if you should believe that
every Irishman is a Roman Catholic unless he knocks you down
for looking as if you thought so.

How often the Pithoeanus is abandoned perforce‚ even by
those who love it far better than truth and reason, appears to be
little known3 so let me render a brief statement of the facts. It
omits five whole verses which the editors accept as genuine; it
further omits one phrase of five words, three phrases of three
words, two phrases of two words, and sixteen single words not
eounting monosyHables, which the editors admit into their text
from other MSS 3 and, leaving out of count a vast number of errors
too trivial for record in an ‘apparatus uere criticus,’ there are
more than a hundred places where the editors reject its readings
and take the readings of other MSS instead.

That there is no hope of resolving particular questions by the
general proposition that P is the best MS, would be clearly
perceived if men used language to clothe their thoughts and not
to muffle them, and took care to have in their minds ideas
accurately corresponding to the phrases which stream from their
tongues and pens. The difference between P and Ψ is this.
Upon Ψ there has been rained a shower of interpolation which in
scores of places has obliterated the original text and overlaid it
