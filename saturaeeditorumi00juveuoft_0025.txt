SATVRAE xxi

your task is only to plaster it on Juvenal, and this needs nothing
but ignorance and insensibility. Others however have been first
in the field and some of these jewels are already sparkling
in the text: you will hardly guess which, so I enumerate them:
v1 73, v111 88, IX 41, x 312, xi 184, xiv 113. But there are
as bad fish in the sea as ever came out of it: I advise you to
begin with IV 99 and read ‘profuit ergo nihil, miseros (P, misero Ψ)
quod comminus ursos Ι figebat Numidas ' 3 for surely a bear which
is speared deserves much more pity than the man who spears it.
The less wits, the less taste, the less Latin you have, the more of
these readings will you accept from the best MS. And when you
have accepted as many as ever you can, and reviewers are
praising your sound critical method, then I will go out into the
fields and bring home from the plough-tail an agricultural labourer
who can accept them all.

It is curious, and yet not ummtural, that while editors are
scrambling for the readings of P, and disfiguring their texts with
its false readings, more than one of its true readings have been
trampled underfoot in the stampede. At XI 151 it has ‘pastoris
duri hic filius, ille bubulci,’ which is quite faultless 3 yet the editors
resort to worse MSS which offer the metrica] interpolations laic
est and est hic. At X 197 atque alio, XII 14 iret et arandi, and XIII
49 nondum sortitus, the readings of P are unmetrical and therefore
corrupt, but they are simple and honest corruptions from which
the truth may be recovered: the metrica] readings atquc ille alio,
iret et a mandi, nondum aliquis sortitus, which the editors adopt
from inferior MSS, only spread the corruption further.1

Now, to show the individual characters of the seven MSS

1 In the matter of orthography most editors of the Latin classics now follow
the advice of Lachmann at Lucr. 1 125, ‘ita sentio, et posse et debere nos in
plerisque uti orthographia saeculi quarti, neque nobis recentiora admittere
licere3 sed summam constantiam in dicendo scribendoue quaerere animi
illiberalis est.’ Relics of an earlier spelling, whether the author’s or only the
archetype’s‚ are accepted where the MSS offer them, as good MSS often will.
From the orthography of Messrs Buecheler and Friedlaender I have diverged
no 111016 111611 15 necessary: the difference is that they accept early spellings
from P alone, and 1 from other MSS as well.

The better the MSS we possess of any Latin author, the seldomer do we find
tunc before a guttural : in Virgil the authority for tum is overwhelming. And
we know that scribes, when a guttural followed, would change tum to tuvzc3
for in Lucr. 1 130 we find ‘tunc cum primis' and in Val. Fl. 1 402 ‘tzmc
caelata,’ where the authors must have written tum, because tunc is excluded
by the sense. So Juvenal's editors rightly read 111 214 ⁴ tum geminus ’ with P
(and 0) and vu 108 ‘ tum 611111 ⁷ with P (and AOU) 3 but I read also x 47 ‘ tum
