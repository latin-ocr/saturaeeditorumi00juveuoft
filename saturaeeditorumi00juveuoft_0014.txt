Probus
Vallae

x IVVENALIS

These, like most bodies of scholia, are not the work of a single
hand nor of a single age 3 but their oldest portion is the oldest
authority we have, and often retains or indicates a genuine
reading which has perished from all existing MSS. They are
printed in Jahn's edition of 1851. Georgius Valla, who edited
Juvenal at Venice in 1486, possessed and often quoted a very
similar collection of scholia, reaching no further than VIII 198,
which he ascribed to one ‘Probus grammaticus.’

The Pithoeanus was first applied to the recension of Juvenal

1 in 1585 by its godfather Petrus Pithoeus. His text, founded on

this MS, served in 1613 as a model to Rigaltius, and Rigaltius
served as a model to editors of Juvenal for near two hundred
years. From 1800 onward, when P had long disappeared,
Ruperti first, and then Achaintre and Heinrich, produced recensions
founded on inferior MSS. But in the middle of the century the
Pithoeanus was rediscovered at Montpellier and was restored to
its pride of place by Otto Jahn and K. F. Hermann3 and in the
series of modern editions, Jahn’s of 1851, Hermann’s of 1854,
Jahn’s of 1868, Buecheler⁷s of 1886 and 1893, the text of Juvenal
has drawn nearer and nearer to the text of P. The tendency is
not unbroken, for every one of the three editors deserts P in some
places where the others follow it and follows it in some where
they desert it 3 but the upshot is that our present vulgate‚—Mr
Buecheler’s last edition and the very similar text on which ΜΓ
Friedlaender wrote his commentary of 1895,—stands closer to P
than did any earlier recension.

What Ι propose to do is to ari-est this current and turn it back¹
I shall not immediately succeed3 for two things are necessary, of
which Ι can furnish only one. The recension of Juvenal is now
crippled not only by lack of knowledge but by lack of judgment ;
and though Ι can supply the editors with information which they
have neglected to procure for themselves I cannot constrain them
to make a prudent use of it. But under present circumstances no
prudence would avail them much: they cannot now assess with
justice the comparative value of P and of the other MSS, for the
simple reason that they do not know, and do not even inquire,
what those MSS contain. P, says Mr Buecheler on p. 113 of
Friedlaender's edition, ‘ist die beste Handschrift des Juvenal,
weil sie an vielen Stellen allein das Richtige erhalten hat, und die
ihr eigenthiimlichen Lesungen z. B. der Consulname Iunco XV 27
