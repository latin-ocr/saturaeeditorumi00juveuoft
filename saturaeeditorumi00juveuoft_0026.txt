collectively designated Ψ, Ι will make a list of the passages where
the truth or its traces are found in only one or two of them,
aecompanied now and then by Vind. or by certain other MSS of
less importance. XVhere the first hand of P, now erased, appears

to have agreed with them, I add (P).

The Greek words cycnus and Procne often appear in good Latin MSS, though
not in the best, as cyqnus and Proque. But the appearance of this form in MSS
is no indication that the author used it3 for even in places where the metre
proves that the author wrote cn, as Hor. carm. IV 3 20 offeni, Ouid. met. VI 468
Procnes, Petr. 131 Pro‘cne, the vast majority of MSS offer 9η. The position then
is this : we know that ancient authors sometimes wrote cycnus and Procne, we
do not know that they ever wrote cyqnus and Proque ; we know that scribes
sometimes altered the c to 9, we do not know that they ever altered the 9 to c.
If therefore all our MSS agree 111 cyqnus or Proque, we shall yield them a
sceptieal acquiescence ε if they differ, we shall prefer Procne and cycnus, The
editors· rightly accept cycno at VI 165, apparently on the sole authority of P,
and cycnum at VIII 33, where P is reinforced by G and other iuss. At VI 644
they print Proyne, which is in P; but Ι have found Procne in GOT and
adopted it.

The spelling -2's in the ace. plur. of i-nouns is often presewed by P where
most iuss have —es. In four places where P has -es the spelling -is is preserved
by another MS,—by Vind. in II 44 omnis, by G in XI 122 orbis, 155 qualis,
XIV 194 uaris.

There are six places where acolyzcs, uoltus, uolua are admitted on the
authority of P, reinforced by U at XV 36, 170. At 111 150 and VIII 270 and
X 189 and XI 81, where P has the later spelling, I accept uolnere from L and
Volcania and uoltu from G and uolua from F G.

At XI 103, where Ψ have equus, P has aecus and the editors write ecu53
and at XII 77 they adopt from P relinqunt, which Ι have found also in Brit. 15
B XII and XVIII. I further adopt locuntur from Vind. Ψ at Iv 17 and secuntur
from Ψ at X 58, where P has loquuntur and sequuntur.
