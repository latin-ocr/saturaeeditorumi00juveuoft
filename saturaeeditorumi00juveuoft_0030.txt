From the crossing of relationships and interchange of readings
in Juvenal's MSS there issues a consequence troublesome to the
truth-seeker and annoying to the formulist yet not-on the whole
disadvantageous to the author. It is this: that scraps of truth
are found in unlikely quarters, and that no MS, until it has been
read through, can safely be discarded. Let me first illustrate
this condition of affairs from XV 1-43‚ where we possess, side
by side with our familiar MSS, the fragmentum Bobiense,
written, so they say, in the 4th century.

At XV 25 Ψ have

de Corcyraea temetum deduxerat urna,
and so has the frag. Bob. Only in P does duzerat survive 3 though
A's produxerat is a sign that A's exemplar had the true reading
and the copyist corrupted it 101 himself.

At XV 7 Ψ have illic caeruleos, and so again has the frag. Bob.
P has micam-aleos, but adds a corruption of its own, illi for illic at
the end of the verse. Only in U, and hardly there, survives the
true reading illic aeluros.

Now in these two places,1 where not merely error but identical
error has invaded MSS 01 1116 9111 and the 4th centuries, the truth
has been saved, once by a single MS of 1116 9111 century, once by a
single MS 01 1116 11111. These facts, which are part and parcel 01
1116 general untidiness 01 1116 universe, will be distasteful to many
critics whose love 01 1163111655 15 stronger than their Creator's, and

¹ So too at XIV 30 the evidently true lection moechum is preserved by P and
U, though the moechos of Ψ 15 cited by Priscian four times over and was
therefore already current in the eth century.
