xxxii IVVENALIS

doubt, as IX 79-80, X 323, XIII 183, 236: sententious verses,
all of them redundant, some of them flat. Moralists however are
often flat, and poets of the silver age redundant; and although
for J uvenal's sake we may hope that these lines are spurious, we
are not entitled to believe them so. V 140 is worse, and appears
inconsistent with 132—63 but to eject it will not clear up its
context, the most obscure in Juvenal. XII 29 again is not only
superfluous but beside the mark, yet without Catullo there will
be no subJ‘ect for coepit in U. 34. VI 558—9 and XIV 208—9 stand
apart: they have no business to be where they are, but they are
not interpolations 3 they are antique fragments, the former
probably of Juvenal, the latter probably of some elder poet.
The verses IV 8, VIII 7, Ill-2, XV 97—8, are verses which
Juvenal cannot indeed have written as they stand, but which
nevertheless it is absurd to call interpolated, because no in—
terpolator could have written them either. If we desire to have
it believed that a line has been inserted by a scribe, we must
explain what the scribe meant by inserting it. If we cannot,
and if the line is nevertheless insufferable‚ then it is not
interpolated but corrupt.

Some of the verses which I mark as spurious are correct
explanations or summaries of what Juvenal is saying, but no
more suited for insertion into J uvenal's discourse than a Livian
periocha is suited for insertion into a book of Livy. ‘ Who’ asks
the poet at XIII 162-5 ‘was ever amazed at wens in the Alps or
blue eyes in Germany'l' Nobody, the reader is expected to
reply 3 for he knows that in those places they are common. This
was understood aright by the student who noted in the margin
‘ nempe quod haec illis natura est omnibus una ' (which verse, for
the benefit of editors who do not know what it meanS, though
they are sure that it is genuine, I will translate: ‘obviously
because all those folk are of this same type ’) 3 but the explanation
is not so framed that it will fit into the text, unless nempe is
altered to nemo. Again at VIII 258, when Juvenal has said in
three lines of vigorous rhetoric what he wants to say, that the
Decii were ample quittance to Earth and Hell for legions and
auxiliaries and every Latin that bore arms, there follows in the text
what was meant for the margin, a curt matter-of-fact comment
or paraphrase ‘pluris enim Decii quam quae seruantur ab illis.'

In these two places it is only from the contents of the verses
that we judge them to be the annotations of a commentator 3 but
