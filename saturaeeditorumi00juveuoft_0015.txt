and P (as corrected, for P's first reading was Iunpo), but also by
A, as Mr Buecheler might have learnt from Hosius, by U, as he
might have learnt from Jahn, and by at least twenty-two MSS into
the bargain. My work will enable the public, and will thus in a
measure compel the editors, to employ their judgment, be it
sound or crazy, upon facts. This is the first requisite, that the
readings of the MSS should be known. The second is that they
should be treated, as they now are not, with impartiality.

What here follows, on pp. xi-xvi, is meant for one only of
the three classes into whose hands this book will come. It is
not for those who are critics: they know it already and will
find it nothing but a string of truisms. Itis not for those who
never will be critics : they cannot grasp it and will find it nothing
but a string of paradoxes. It is for beginners 3 for those who
are not critics yet, but are neither too dull to learn nor too sels-
satisfied to wish to learn.

Open a modern recension ot* a classic, turn to the preface, and
there you may almost count on finding, in Latin or German or
English, some words like these: ‘1 have made it my rule to
follow a wherever possible, and only where its readings are
patently erroneous have I had recourse to b or c or d.’ No
scholar of eminence, even in the present age, has ever enunciated
such a principle. Some, to be sure, like ΜΓ Buecheler in his
Juvenal, have virtually assumed it in their practice, as a con-
venient substitute sor mental exertion 5 but to blurt it out as a
maxim is an indiscretion which they leave to their unrefiecting
imitatore, who formulate the rule without misgiving and practise
it with conscious pride.

Either a is the source of b and c and (l or it is not. If it is,
then never in any case should recourse be had to b or c or d. If
it is not, then the rule is irrationa13 for it involves the assump—
tion that wherever a's scribes made a mistake they produced an
impossible reading. Three minutes' thought would suffice to
find this out, but thought is irksome and three minutes is a
long time.

How, you may ask, did the mind of man ever excogitate
anything so false and foolish‘.² The answer is that the mind of
man had nothing to do with it. What the mind sets up the mind
