vi IVVENALIS

is hardly more than a collation of P. It is valuable, but even as
a collation it is marred by defects and superfluities. Its defects
are trifles, and consist in matters orthographical: we learn from
Mr Buecheler when P has aput for apud and haut for haud, but
we do not learn when it has set for secl or quod for quot or adque
for atque. Its superfiuities on the other hand compose the greater
part of it ; for its greater part is its record of readings imported
by the corrector or correctors p. p should be cited, as Jahn
cited it, for one purpose and for one alone. VVhere P is obliter-
ated, there the reading of p affords a means of judging what the
reading of P was not: everywhere else it is worse than useless.
For p is in effect a bad MS of the common class, and it mis-
represents that class ,- and nothing has more obscured the textual
criticism of Juvenal than the practice of comparing and contrast-
ing P, not with a good sample of the inferior family, but with
one of the worst that can be found.

An apparatus criticus Mr Buecheler’s notes are not. He
writes on p. xvi

plurimos quenalis codices ipse perlustraui aut ab aliis ita descriptos accepi
ut potestas fieret iudicandi, sufficiunt exemplo quorum lectiones Car. Hosius
collegit in apparatu critico (Bonnae 1888) et in museo rhen. XLVI p. 287
memorauit, cumque quod frater Pithoeani habuit peculium id Pithoeano paene
totum indidisse correctores uiderem, de P et p diligenter rettuli, ceteros omisi
nisi ubi horum adiecta memoria declarari posse aut compleri putabam saturarum
a Nicaeo ad Heiricum historiam. ceterum nisi nouae chartae emerserint, hunc
dilectum codicum ad Persium et quenalem tantidem esse arbitror quasi omnis
omnium discrepantia sit adnotata.

To examine ‘plurimos quenalis codices' was not necessary:
it was enough to cast an understanding eye on the collations of
Hosius and especially on the excerpts of Jahn. The chief profit
accruing to Juvenal from my apparatus is not derived from ‘nouae
chartae’ (except indeed that the Oxoniensis preserves some thirty
verses nowhere else surviving) but from Jahn's Vrbinas 661 and
Parisiensis 790012. How much Mr Buecheler is deceived in
thinking that the truth peculiar to the vulgar MSS has ‘paene
totum’ been amassed by p, will be clear to any one who com-
pares my text and notes with his: here I will only remark that
at ΙΙΙ 109 he adopts from p the barefaced interpolation est nec,
which not a single decent MS contains, while at Χ 155 he does
not even mention the evidently genuine acti, which is in almost
every decent MS excepting P. In one case Mr Buecheler is not
himself ignorant of the facts but has kept his readers ignorant.
