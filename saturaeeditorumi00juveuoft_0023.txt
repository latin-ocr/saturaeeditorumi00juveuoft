SATVRAE xix

likely to proceed from a scribe. Ψ 111 their turn are evidently
right at 35 palpat Ψ, om. P, 38 noctibus Ψ, uon tibi P, 85 timor Ψ,
0111. P, 155 lucebis Ψ, lucebit P. Next take the cases where there
is nothing to choose, -2 Cordi P, Codri Ψ, 21 ac P, et Ψ, 98 ac Ρ,
et Ψ, 135 caulis P, ocules Ψ; here we all follow Ρ, most editors
with confidence‚ Ι with none. But now come two places where
I have adopted P's reading though it is somewhat less probable
than Ψ’5. At 47 P has ‘cum populum gregibus comitum premit
hic spoliator Ι pupilli prostantis, et hic damnatus inani Ι iudicio,’
with which there is no fault to find. But Ψ have at, which is
livelier, which is thus used in ΠΙ 246 ‘ferit hic cubito, ferit assere
duro Ι alter, at hic tignum capiti incutit, ille metretam,’ and which
when thus used is frequently altered in MSS to et. Again at 114,
where Ρ 1135 ‘etsi funesta pecunia templo Ι nondum habitat’ and
Ψ habitas, the apostrophe is preferable as less obvious and is pre-
ferred by ΜΓ Friedlaender: that the —as was engendered by
nullas following or maiestas overhead is possible indeed but hardly
probable. Here then Ι have twice sided with P against my
judgment. But Ι (10 not carry complaisance so far as to read
in 142 sq. ‘ cum tu deponis amictus Ι turgidus et crudus (Ρ, crudum
Ψ) pauonem in balnea portas': this distribution of adjectives is
so aimless and this arrangement of words is so misleading that
to accept crudus will entail altering porlas to portans. Again
in 144—6 ‘hinc subitae mortes atque intestata senectus Ι et
(Ρ, it AL) noua nec tristis per cunctas fabula cenas Ι ducitur iratis
plaudendum funus amicis,' however 144 is interpreted and however
145 sq. are punctuated, et is no proper link between the general
statements in 144 and the statements about one individual in
145 sq. 3 and it is oftener and easier corrupted to et than is et to
it. Further at 150 ‘dices (P, dicas Ψ) hic forsitan ' the subjunctive
is preferable, and indeed most editors prefer it, for two reasons:
because forsitan in Juvenal regularly takes the subjunctive, and
because, apart from forsitan, the subjunctive is usual when
no definite person is addressed. Once more, at 156 ‘qui fixo
pectore (P, qutture Ψ) fumant‚' gutture, read by the scholiast, is
on every count superior: superior palaeographically‚ as the less
common word, and superior in sense, because to fasten a victim
by the throat involves less trouble, consumes less material, and
causes more discomfort, than to fasten him by the chest. Lastly
at 168 ‘inde irae (P, ira Ψ) et lacrimae' the singular im, not the
plural irae, is the just and proper counterpart to the plural
