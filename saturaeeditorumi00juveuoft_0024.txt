xx IVVENALIS

lacrimae, which is of another nature 3 and when it is a question
between iraet and iraeet there is no such thing as MS authority:
both readings existed, beyond a doubt, in J uvenal⁷s own lifetime.
This is no way to earn applause. But to the common sort
of reviewers Ι say with Seneca laudari me a uobis, ‘nisi laudaretis
etiam malos, uellem: you should be welcome to praise me if you
did not praise one another. If applause were what I wanted,
applause Ι would have, for I know the way, and it is easy.
Applause is to be earned by outdoing the last editor in partiality
for P and adopting false readings which the last editor was
shrewd enough to reject. To echo the vaunt of Priam, ἔτλην
οῗ οὔ πώ rio· ἐπιχθόνιοσ βροτόσ· ἅλλοσ, ‘I have tolerated such
things as nobody in the world ever tolerated before,' has now for
years been the chief ambition of each fresh editor of Juvenal.
The progress of depravation is not however rapid, nor the sum
of damage considerable3 for each fresh editor, while importing his
own corruptions, expels a certain number of the corruptions im—
ported by his predecessor: the bloom of novelty is evanescent
and does not long disguise the native badness of the goodS. P has
two besetting sins : it adds or subtracts the letter 3 at the end of a
word, especially if the next word begins with s or f 3 and it makes
mistakes in the tense, the person, the number, and especially the
mood, of verbs. In the interest of those who wish to receive
praise without deserving it I have taken the trouble to make a
pretty complete list of these blunders3 and 1 trust that my
humble diligence may smooth the next editor's path to glory.
