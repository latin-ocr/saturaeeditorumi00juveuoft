can pull down, and fancies based on false reasons can be over-
thrown by true reasons. But if true reasons could overthrow
this fancy it would have been overthrown long before our time;
by Madvig for instance in opusc. ΙΙ pp. 298-319. Its strength
is that it has no reasons, only causes, Its root is not in the
mind but in the sou13 and it partakes the solidity of its inde-
structible foundations, the sloth and vanity of man.

The task of editing the classics is continually attempted by
scholars who have neither enough intellect nor enough literature.
Unless a false reading chances to be unmetrical or ungrammatical
they have no means of knowing that it is false. Show them these
variants,

molliaque{ Πῖἷῖῃηζὲῖίἓε } fixit in ora manus,

and they cannot tell which is right and which is wrong; and,
what is worse, they honestly believe that nobody else can tell.
If you suppose yourself able to distinguish a true reading from
a false one‚—suppose yourself, that is, to be a critic, a man
capable of doing what the Greeks called xpc'vewp—they are aghast
at your assurance. Ι am aghast at theirs: at the assui-auce of
men who do not even imagine themselves to be critics, and yet
presume to meddle with criticism.

What a criticis, and what advantage he has over those who
are not critics, can easily be shown by one example. Cicero's
oration pro rege Deiotaro was edited between 1830 and 1840
by Klotz, Soldan, and Benecke. The best MS then known was
the Erfurtensis‚ and all three editors pounced on this authority
and clung to it, believing themselves safe. Madvig in 1841,
maintaining reason against superstition in Cicero’s text as I
now maintain it in Juvenal's, impugned 17 readings adopted
from the Erfurtensis by these editors, and upheld the readings
of inferior MSS. We now possess MSS still better than the
Erfurtensis‚ and in 12 of the 17 places they contradict it, they
confirm the inferior MSS and the superior critic. Authority itself
has crossed over to the side of reason and left superstition in
the lurch.

But there are editors destitute of this discriminating faculty,
so destitute that they cannot even conceive it to exist 3 and
these are entangled in a task for which nature has neglected
to equip them. What are they now to do? Set to and try
to learn their trade'.2 that is forbidden by sloth. Stand back
