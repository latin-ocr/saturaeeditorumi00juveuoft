SATVRAE xxvii

they will hasten to forget them: Ι bear them in mind 3 and Ι
argue that if a single MS of the IIth century can be right where
MSS not only of the 9th but of the 4th century are wrong, and
wrong with the same error, there is no reason why a single MS
even of the 15th century should not retain the truth when MSS of
the 9th and lOth and 11th have lost it. But no argument is
wanted : the thing has happened elsewhere. The only extant MS
of Horace which at serm. 1 6 126 has preserved, in the corruption
campum lusitque triqonem, a vestige of what Horace wrote, is
‘Gothanus chart. Β 61 inter annos 1456-1467 scriptus': all the
rest, even of the lOth and the 9th centuries, exhibit the inter-
polation rabiosi tempora siqui.

I attach no weight to such examples as XIV 216 maturae or XVI
24 caliyas tot in a few late MSS: these are probably emendations,
and so perhaps are VI 213 uolet, 533 liniyer0‚ VIII 4 humero, 66
trito et, 229 Melanippes, XI 178 faciunt, while VII 177 scindes may
be no more than an accident. But to explain as conjectures the
nitidus of Brit. 15 B XVIII at III 157 and the frater of Paris, 8291
at V 137 is not plausible 3 and to explain as conjectures certain
readings of my youngest MS, Burn. 192, is not possible.

This MS, late, corrupt, and interpolated‚ is distinguished
throughout by its high indifference to metre‚ and in several places
by its close agreement with P. The following readings are either
peculiar to P and Burn. 192 or are shared by them with very few
other MSS: III 188 praestare, 293 conche, IV 18 si, VI 345 Clodius,
X 197 ille om., XIV 199 trepidum, 247 cauea. Its contempt for
metre has stood it in good ste-ad at VIII 148, where it preserves
the true reading under the slight disguise of sub flamine multo
consul. Accordingly when I find in this MS experanda at VII 22
and quis erit et at XI 148, where Ι had conjectured speranda and
qui steterit years before I knew of its existence, Ι regard these
readings as confirmation of my conjectures and as relies of the
truth. VVhether its omission of iqitur at XII 78 is more than an
accident Ι do not venture to decide.

There are in the world, I doubt not, other MSS in which other
remnants of a genuine tradition still lurk unseen. Among Jahn's‚
after FGU, the most promising seems to be Laur. XXXIV 423
among Ruperti's, Gaybacensis 2 ; and the three Roman codices
from which Mr Hosius Rhein. Mus. uol. XLVI p. 289 quotes
sufflamine multo consul at VIII 148 may merit further scrutiny,
though one of them, like Burn. 192, is of the 15th century.
