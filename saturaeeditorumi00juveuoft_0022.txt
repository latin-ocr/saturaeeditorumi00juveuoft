Now when I encounter a diserepaney between P and Ψ I ask
myself to which of these two categories it belongs. The modern
editors (10 not: they assume, if they can, that it belongs to the
former. 111 the following places and others, where P is now
preferred to Ψ, Ι have preferred Ψ to P: Ι 156 yattwre Ψ, pectore

olim P. That in every one of these places I have chosen rightly
is more than I ean hope. The superstitious have full saith in
their superstitious, but those who follow reason are well aware
that reason is no infallible guide.

This impartiality is what partisans will eall partisanship3
and Mr Buecheler’s henchmen, not Mr Buecheler himself, will
say that I favour Ψ and am hostile to P. I cannot prevent them
from saying this, but what I can do, that I will: I will ensure
that when they say it they shall say not only what is false but
what is evidently and inexcusably false. Since my aim is not
so much to produce a good text of Juvenal as to reform J uvenalian
criticism and encourage future editors to produce good 101115, Ι have
sacrifices] truth to worldly wisdom and controversia] strategy:
not only have I preferred P to Ψ where they are equal, but in
places where Ψέ readings are slightly the more probable I have
steadily wrested the balance in favour of P. Let me run through
the First satire.

P is evidently right at 44 Laqudunensem P, Lseiqd- Ψ, 52
Heracleas P, Herculeias Ψ, 67 salsi P, falso Ψ (here I remark that
so long as falso was supposed to be P's reading it stood firm in
the text and Markland's conjecture falsi was disregarded), 161
uerbum P, aeram Ψ, and to these passages may be added 110,
where ae seems better than aec, and 126, where P's quiescet,
though not better than quiescit, is less obvious and was less
