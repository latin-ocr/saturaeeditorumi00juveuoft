SATVRAE xxv

tion would not remove. Take two contrasted examples. When
at XIV 38 sq. POU have ‘abstineas igitur damnandis ,· liuius enim
uel Ι una potens ratio est' and Ψ have ςἀαγηηίε, huiusce etenim,''
this is interpolation, consequent on the absorption of and by amn.
But when at VII 139 sq. PG have ‘fidimus eloquio? Ciceroni nemo
ducentos Ι nuno dederit nummos' and Ψ have ‘ut redeant ueteres,
Ciceroni' etc., there is no ground for calling one lection interpo-
lated rather than the other: we cannot be sure which Juvenal
wrote 3 we cannot even be sure that he wrote either. These are
such variants as we find in Mart. XI 39 10 ‘et uix a ferulis
temperat ira tua (abstinet ira manum) 'z both, it appears, date back
to ancient recensions3 neither, it may be, to the poet himself.
That Priscian too read fidimus eloquio is not decisive in its favour:
Priscian read rob07e with the Vossianus at Luc. IV 131 where the·
‘cana salix madefacto uimine paruam Ι texitur in puppim ' of other
MSS is evidently superior. To this class I should assign the
following variants in Juvenal: Ι 156 qutture Vind. ΨΣ, pectore
PAO, V 63 roqatus P Vind. Ao, uocatus Ψ, VI 238 silet ΡΟ, pauet
ΨΣ, VII 25 componis PAGU, conscribis FLOT, 145 Gallus PFGU,
Cossus ALOT, V111 93 Tutor ΨΣ, Numitor PS, 179 Pontice ΡΨ, Reyule
GU, IX 148 uocatur PA, rogatur Ψ, Χ 112 uulnere ΡΨ, sanquine GU
Seruius, 160 fuyit PAGU, abit FLOT, 189 recto uoltu solum hoc et
PAGT, altus caelumque tuens hoc LO, XIV 293 coempti ΡΨ, coemptor·
AL Priscian, XV 46 turha PT, ripa ΨΣ, XVI 23 mulino Psz,
Mutinensi ΨΣ,

Now L, which of all the seven MSS is the most remote from P,
owes this remoteness not simply to interpolation but also to the
fact that it maintains more constantly than the others an ancient
tradition which is not the tradition of P. It is on the whole, I
think, an inferior tradition, but it forms a valuable and necessary
¹ supplement to the superior. Only L is no Abdiel: it is the
ζ typical MS of the common class 5 and where it upholds the truth
¹ against P it upholds it in company and has other witnesses to
,² bear it out. In G and U, where they are not interpolated, may
be traced a third tradition, better than L's and less remote from
’ P. F and 0 and T are more composite in character.

The most ancient author who quotes much from Juvenal is
’ Seruius. Among his citations there are thirteen passages where
our principal MSS are at odds 3 and he now takes one side, now
1 another. In three lections, all apparently right, IX 53 tractat PG
