SATVRAE xxxv

the ‘praecipue causis' of 11. 120 followed without sense3 and the
interpolator meant his verse 119 to be substituted for 120-1.
Instead of this it was inserted before them, but in MSS where
u, 118 ended with his and therefore cohered with 120 this insertion
was impossible, so the spurious line was postponed to the end of
the paragraph, after 123.

That XI 165-6 are likewise a marginal addition, prompted
perhaps by a vague wish to provide some meaning for ‘alterius
sexus ' in u. 168, their own irrelevance and imbecility are enough
to show 3 but external evidence points the same way. One third
of the MSS omit them 3 the remainder insert them in no fewer
than nine different places.

Lastly I mention VI 188, which cannot with certainty be
pronounced an interpolation, because it is hard to understand how
even an interpolator can have written it. It is so nearly meaning-
less, and what meaning it has, if it has any, is so absurd, that
perhaps corruption and not interpolation has been at work here:
‘cum sit turpe in agris nostris nunc seire Latine‚' ‘since now-a-
days it is counted a disgrace to know Latin in Latium‚' would
make tolerable sense.

The best-known essay in defence of suspected verses is
Mr Vahlen's in the ind. lect. uniu. Berol. 1884. Mr Vahlen has
an easy task in vindicating VII 138, VIII 140-1, V 51, III 104;
he fails with V 66 and XI 99, because he does not grasp, and
therefore cannot answer, the objections which they incur3 and his
efforts to defend VII 51—2 and 111 281 are deplorable. This last
verse, of all interpolations in Juvenal, is the most ruinous and the
most evident: it is triply condemned by sense, by diction, and by
metre. ‘Qui expungunt uersum notatum,' says Mr Vahlen,
‘sententiam deteriorem reddere uidentur, si quidem uerum non est
rixam somnum facere, uerum quibusdam facere somnum.' It
appears therefore that Mr Vahlen, by the time he arrives at
u. 281, has already forgotten u. :7 8, and no longer remembers
that the sole theme of the passage is the ‘ebrius ac petulans qui
nullum forte cecidit.’ The interpolation took its rise from some
less oblivious annotator, who wrote in the margin, against ‘ somnum
rixa facit,’ the correct explanation ‘non aliter poterit dormire.'
This sentence happened to be metrical, and was furnished with a
head and a tail and turned into a sort of hexameter by some one
who knew no more than Mr Vahlen that e‘ryo in Juvenal is
a trochee.
