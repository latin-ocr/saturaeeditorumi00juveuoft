xiv IVVENALIS

never asked himself. thence comes authority? In what does
the goodness of a MS consist‚ and upon what does our belief in its
goodness repose? If any one has heard a voice from heaven
saying ‘P is the best MS of Juvenal,' let him take example by M.
Caedicius and carry his tale to the magistrates. But if not, then
the goodness of a MS consists simply and solely in the goodness of
the readings which it proffers 3 and our belief in its goodness,
that is to say in the goodness of its readings, reposes simply and
solely upon our judgment: upon that same judgment which we
are now forbidden to exercise. then you invoke the authority
of a MS against the exercise of the judgment, you are inciting the
creature to rebel against the creator, and you are sapping the
very ground on which you stand. If nobody can tell a true
reading from a false reading, it follows of necessity that nobody
can tell a truthful MS from a lying MS. Continue then, if you
like, to urge that the judgment of critics is fallible‚ as indeed it
is, but desist from talking in the same breath about the
superiority of one MS to another 3 for this phrase either means
nothing at all, or else it means that the one MS has been placed
above the other by the fallible judgment of crities.

Take another aspect of the case. If a student, desiring to
find out whether Pindar was stupid or no, should begin to read
him, would any one touch him on the shoulder and say ‘Shut
that book: Boeotians were stupid, Pindar was a Boeotian,
therefore Pindar was stupid'te No, not even a ‘sane critic':
even he reserves such reasoning for his own ghostly realm of
make-believe, and does not carry it into the waking world where
men pursue their business in the daylight and detect petitio
principii. XVhether Boeotians were stupid, and to what extent,
can only be settled by considering on its intrinsic mex-its the case
of every known Boeotian‚ and Pindar's case among the rest.
And whether P is the best MS of Juvenal, and to what extent,
can only be settled by considering on its intrinsic merits every
discrepancy between P and the other MSS. If, while we are
engaged in so considering one of these discrepancies, you interrupt
us with the assertion, possibly quite true, that Pis the best MS
and far the best, we shall reply: ⁶ That is the question which we
are now investigating at a preliminary stage. WVhen we have
made up our minds about this passage, then we will add it
either to the evidence in favour of P or else to the evidence
in favour of Ψ. To warp our choice in this particular instance
